# RootRM
Root level remote management library and command line utility.

I find great interest in malware research and red teaming.
My intentions are to slowly build on this implementing concepts I learn throughout and alongside TryHackMe lessons.
Most of the code will be provided in the library in order to reduce boilerplate code (and if you find something interesting to use).
